## Comparison with Other Mods

Unlike generic trainers that only tweak single-player stats, a Star Citizen cheat is built for live multiplayer environments. While mods like flight assists or reshade packs only enhance visuals, cheat menus give actual advantages: combat dominance, economic exploits, and awareness tools. Compared to single-player space sims like Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen hacks are next-level because the universe is shared and competitive.
